You are lost in the woods but you have your trusty candle by your side to help guide you through the forest.  You are hunted by a death fox god that is the keeper of the forest. Light is saving you from being eaten up by the fox. Use your wits and solve puzzles by lighting torches with the corresponding colors that you can change your candle to by activating mushrooms. Look for lanterns as they save your progress and keep your candle full.
